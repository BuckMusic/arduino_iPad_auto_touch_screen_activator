# arduino_iPad_auto_touch_screen_activator

## In the fall of 2019 just before the word 'covid' was known to 99% of the worlds population, I sorted a way to automatically refresh an iPad website hands free

### The week before Lockdown in London UK, I got in trouble by the management of the organization I was associated

### I had refreshed a website many more times than was expected of me

# This project is more about the possibility to manipulate a capacitive touch screen without your human touch than effectively refreshing a website

# there are many physical and mental disabilities that prevent effective ineraction with touch screens, I hope to share the concept of this project opensource to anyone who may bennefit
