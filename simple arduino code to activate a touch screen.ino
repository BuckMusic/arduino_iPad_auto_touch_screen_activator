// the first inspiration for this project started with this youtube 
//        Arduino Plays Piano Tiles tutorial
//        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hlQ0MiowN8
//
// there are many ways to achieve this process
// there are lots of things to sort out in this project
// there needs to be a wire or wires connected between a touch screen and a controller (in this case the controller is an arduino unit)
// the connection to the touch screen must fulfill certian parameters
//      1. there needs to be about a 1cm square (or round) conductive touch point attached to the touch screen
//      2. the wire connecting the touch point to the controller should be fairly short (as short as possible) 
//      3. the wire should be insulated
//      4. if two or more touch points are used, the wires MUST be seperated by a cm or more along their path
//            if the wires are too close together, they will effect one another and 'funny things' may happen 
//      5. regarding the youtube video above, there are other ways than using relays to 'artifically touch' the touch screen.
//            I stopped using relays after about a month of experiments. This project does NOT include relays.
//
//    OK let's get started
//
//  MATERIALS NEEDED
//      CONTROLLER (Arduino)
//      TOUCH POINT tape
//      WIRE
//
//  THE CONTROLLER
//  An arduino unit. Any arduino will work but this sketch will involve an ARDUINO NANO, I have also used ARDUINO UNO, and ARDUINO MEGA and they work well.
//
//  THE TOUCH POINTS
//  The touch point pads I have found to be the most effective, are made from aluminium adhesive tape. This adhesive is very inexpensive, 
//  widely available, and marketed to secure duct seams.
//
//  THE WIRES
//  Any small guage insulated wire will work. One consideration is to match the guage to a size that will attach securely to the input/output
//  pin sockets of the arduino. Another good idea is to use many different colors of wire along the way.

//  code and more instructions coming soon
